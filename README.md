Job Portal

One stop solution for Job seekers and Recruiters.

An easy to use Job Portal application where job seekers can find good available jobs and Recruiters can find good talent for the company.

In our application we aslo do aggregate jobs from different job portals in one as it not only make life easier for job seekers by creating and applying 100s of jobs but also getting attacked of phising. 

So with the help of our portal folks can come have an account with Metamask where there data is private and without their permission their details won't be updated to any recruiter, with this we keep everything private and anonmyous.

We have also integrated Push Notifications where folks will be getting notifications on new jobs getting published or if they get any update from other protocols which they like to work which makes the hussle process easier.

In the neext update we are also trying to implement Zero-Knowledge proofs in our application were users data will be kept in zk-proofs so that even after getting job while receiving any pay, the user can be anonymous without any fear of public.
